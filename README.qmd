## Abstract




## `r emoji_out`: Note on "verifiable viper" project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting, and peer review, we used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to generate an [Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames) internal-to-us project name that won't change.

```{r}
#| label: generate-code-name
#| eval: false

library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31).

codename(type = "ubuntu", seed = "ngo laws updated aid")
#> [1] "verifiable viper"
```
